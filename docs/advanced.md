## Traefik

When you installed Epinio, it looked at your cluster to see if you had
[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/)
running. If it wasn't there it installed it.

As Epinio only check two namespaces for Traefik's presence, namely
`traefik` and `kube-system`, it is possible that it tries to install
it, despite the cluster having Traefik running. Just in an unexpected
place.

The `install` command provides the option `--skip-traefik` to handle
this kind of situation.

Installing Epinio on your cluster with the command

```bash
$ epinio install --skip-traefik
```

forces Epinio to not install its own Traefik.

Note that having some other (non-Traefik) Ingress controller running
is __not__ a reason to prevent Epinio from installing Traefik. All the
Ingresses used by Epinio expect to be handled by Traefik.
