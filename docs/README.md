We split the docs into two folders: `developer/` and `user/`.
One contains information for developers of Epinio, like how to run tests or set up a local cluster.
The other folder has information for users of Epinio.

The structure of each doc directory is inspired by https://documentation.divio.com/structure/.

Docs are split into four areas:

* `explanations` give background information on key concepts
* `howtos` are more practical and solve specific, sometimes advanced, problems
* `references` contain information, like all CLI commands and their arguments
* `tutorials` teach practical skills for basic use-cases
